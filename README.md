 **** Fire Monitoring and Emergency Response SoS (FM-ERSoS) model checking from architectual specificaiton ****

Open PRISM and press Model tab and then Open Model

Model Capabilities 

Steady-state Analysis 
Transient Anaysis
Known bounds and unkown bounds
Deadlock and liveliness 

1) Download the model files and properties files first 
 Select the model FMERSoS from Model and then click open Model 
2) Then load the model and click on load model by click sub-tab withn Model Menu
3) Check States, Transitions and intial states of CSs within Model 
4) Calcualte steady state probabilities with known bonds and unkonwn bounds 
5) Check transition rewards and state rewards 
6) Change the model parameters as per needs 
7) you can test multiple models seperately for experimentation of complex system stochastic behavior analsis
9) Feel free to modify the models as per needs 
10) Models can be modified considering the Real-Time System needs in the domains of Complex Systems (Smart Cities consisting of  IoTs,Cyber-Physical SoS, smart grids, Critical Infrastructure) where Software Components are main drivers with operational and managerial indpendence. 

11) Performance and Reliability metrics and sub-metrics are calculated with SoS stochastic system dynamics, hower other core Quality Attributes such as Security, Availibility could be evaluated with contextual modifications in models and properites. 

******* See the model how varsious constraints in relation to the SoS Architecture are applied *******

********** Experimentation of CTMC FM-ERSoS Models **********

1) Load the model first by following above steps 
2) Load properites file in CSL  that you have downloaded 
3) Start experimentaitons with properties specification one by one 
4) Evaluate steady state liklihoods with properties in experiments 
5) Evalualte Transient liklihoods to measure Performance and Reliability of FM-ERSoS
