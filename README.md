# FM-ERSoS-Model-Verification-from-HSF-driven-Models


 ************** FM-ERSoS model checking from architectual specificaiton ********************

Open PRISM and press Model tab and then Open Model

Model Capabilities 

Steady state analysis 
Transient Anaysis
Deadlock and liveliness 

1) Download the model files and properties files first 
 Select the model FMERSoS from Model and then click open Model 
2) Then load the model and click on load model by click sub-tab withn Model Menu
3)Check States, Transitions and intial states of CSs within Model 
4) Calcualte steady state probabilities without properties 
5) Check transition rewards and state rewards 

************* See the model how varsious contraints in relation to the SoS Architecture are applied ****************

********* Experimentation of CTMC FM-ERSoS Models ************

1) load the model first by following above steps 
2 ) load properites file in CSL  that you have downloaded 
3) Star experimentaitons with properties specification one by one 
4) Evaluate steady state probabilities with properties in experiments 
5) Evalualte Transient probabilities to measure Performance and Reliability of FM-ERSoS
